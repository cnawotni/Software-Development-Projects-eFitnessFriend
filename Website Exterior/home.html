        <p><span class ="hr3">Hello my name is Jackson. Before I came across iFitnessFriend, I always struggled to maintain a healthy diet for my high blood pressure.
          Trying to find a workout routine that will help me me lose the stubborn fat was always a struggle becuase I was never sure about what exercises to do. 
          Once I came across iFitnessFriend, I was easily able to find meals that I enjoyed and helped me keep my blood pressure low.
          One thing I love about iFitnessFriend is that it suggest workouts to you based on the goals you have set for yourself, and it is easy to add them to the workout list.</span></p>

        <p><span class ="hr3">Hello my name is Greg! I have been using iFitnessFriend for 3 years now.
          Before iFitnessFriend I had a workout routine that I followed but I was not getting the results I wanted. This also applied with the diet and I also found myself breaking the diet or even discontinued it. 
          Once I started using iFitnessFreind, within as short as one week I could see results. 
          The daily reminders and motivational messages allowed me to continue eating healthy and the suggested workouts allowed me to enjoy working out and build muscle much faster.</span></p>

        <p><strong>Lindsey</strong></p>
        <p><span class ="hr3">Hey, my name is Lindsey! I am a mother of three beautiful kids. After my last child I noticed that I gained a reasonable amount of weight. 
          My doctor recommended me to go on a diet and to start exercising, he said if I did not follow his instructions, my blood sugar would spike and I will get diabetes.
          After doing some reasearch on apps that can help me find meals to enjoy to keep my blood sugar low, as well as finding workouts that are not too hard and I can enjoy; I came across iFitnessFriend, I opened the app and before I bought a plan, I looked at the different pages in the app and I could tell it was the perfect one.
          I have now used iFitnessFriend for over 1 year and I can tell you that the plans are worth every penny! The amount of features on this app is amazing and it really helps you stick with your diet and have a workout routine tailored for you from the various options.</span></p>
